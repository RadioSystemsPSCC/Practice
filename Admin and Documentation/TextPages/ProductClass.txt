Product Object should hold:

PartID
PartNumber
PartName 
PartPrice
IsTaxable


Except where noted, this class should look like Customer. The private fields should be camelcase (partName)
and the public property should be Pascal Case (PartName). This object should not have the prices changed, 
so it should look like the Customer class, but it should *not* be linked to Bindable and it should *not* 
give calls to INotifiedPropertyChanged() like the Customer class does. You only do these methods when the 
values should change. If you have a question able the data, look in Products.json for examples. They are
only going to be displayed and not changed, so I've left them as strings right now.

Thanks Aaron!
