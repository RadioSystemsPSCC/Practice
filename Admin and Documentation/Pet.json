According to Microsoft, ASP.NET routing enables you to use URLs that do not have 
to map to specific files in a Web site. Routing has several advantages: 
  1) No longer having to map to a file, and running the risk of an error if the file is moved/removed. 
  2) Being able to use URLs that are descriptive of the user's action.  
  3) Allowing the use of FriendlyURLs that are more easily understood by users.

FriendlyURLs are set up by installing Microsoft.AspNet.FriendlyUrls.Core 
from the package library, setting of a RouteConfig class to redirect and enable FriendlyUrls 
and then uses Global.asax to handle the Application_Start event fired the first time after being 
configured to call RegisterRoutes on the RouteConfig class and send it a command to register routes to 
enable FriendlyUrls to run properly.

A Global.asax file is an application file normally found in the root directory in ASP.net projects.
It is an optional file that contains code for responding to application-level and session events 
raised by ASP.NET. It handles the Application_Start event that initiates route mapping and enables
the use of FriendlyURLs.
