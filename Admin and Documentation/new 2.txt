Scenario: Clocking out
Actor: Employee

Employee returns to job site? and connects with CRM (Do they have to return or do they just get on wifi?)
CRM authenticates?? Does the system do this and how? Login? Open session? 
Employee updates contract information and PDF?? Does PDF upload? Is it stored in the CRM, or just referenced by path or emailed to someone else?
CRM stores data (Does this project use Json objects, XML or something else for web API? ) 
(Does web API clear sqLite once uploaded?) and logs out??
