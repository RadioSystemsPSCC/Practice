Meeting Questions

1.) How often would you like to update/meet? Are these meetings going to be in person?

//Im thinking of not mentioning node.js and react.js in the question below since it seems to be required for Electron.
//Also, I left git off becasue that doesn't have anything to do with him
//We can change this if you guys want to

2.) Are there any technologies that we need to know or learn for this project other than .NET, 
 javascript, Electron?


//For the question below, I'm assuming that we need to use the same type of SQL that is used for RCS's database. This 
//might be wrong lol. Someone let me know if it is

3.) Do you use microsoft SQL, or Oracle, or what for your database that our device will be connecting to? And we should
-use that same type of SQL for our device, correct?
